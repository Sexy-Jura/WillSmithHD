§2Now this is a story all about how

§3My life got flipped-turned upside down

§2And I'd like to take a minute

§3Just sit right there

§2I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

§3In west Philadelphia born and raised

§2On the playground was where I spent most of my days

§3Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool

§2And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school

§3When a couple of guys who were up to no good

§2Started making trouble in my neighborhood

§3I got in one little fight and my mom got scared

§2She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

§3I begged and pleaded with her day after day

§2But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way

§3She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket

§2I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"

§3First class, yo, this is bad

§2Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass

§3Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?

§2Hmm, this might be alright

§3But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that

§2Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?

§3I don't think so

§2I'll see when I get there

§3I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

§2Well, the plane landed and when I came out

§3There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet

§2I just got here

§3I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

§2I whistled for a cab and when it came near

§3The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror

§2If anything I could say that this cab was rare

§3But I thought, "Nah, forget it"

§2– "Yo, home to Bel-Air"

§3I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8

§2And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later"

§3I looked at my kingdom

§2I was finally there

§3To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
